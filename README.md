# youtube_but_it_sucks

After wasting countless hours on YouTube shorts, I decided to take matters into my own hand and create a simple app that allows me to watch YouTube videos without the distractions of shorts.
This Flutter app works by simply serving a webview of the YouTube website, with some custom css and routing rules to block out shorts.


## Running the app
To run the app, you need to have Flutter installed on your machine. You can follow the instructions on the [Flutter website](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) to set up Flutter.
Once you have Flutter installed, you can clone this repository and run the app using the following commands:

```bash
flutter pub get // Install dependencies
flutter run // Run the app
```
